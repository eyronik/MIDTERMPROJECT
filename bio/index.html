They always emphasized the importance of learning and respect for elders. I spent my days outdoors, climbing trees, flying kites, and playing with friends. My curiosity led me to disassemble toys just to see how they worked. There was a time when I developed a passion for reading, trying to read anything I saw. My parents encouraged me to ask questions, which deepened my love for learning. School became an exciting place where I absorbed new knowledge eagerly. My teachers described me as attentive and thoughtful. Despite being shy, I found comfort in my close group of friends. Family gatherings were always filled with laughter, food, and stories.
